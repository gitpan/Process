Module:      Process.pm 
Version:     1.1
Author:      Michael Schilli
Date:        96/05/18

Description: This Module helps controlling background processes.
             Either shell processes or perl subroutines can be started
             in background, polled if they're still running, and
             killed or notified by a unix signal.

Logic:       
             use Process;
             $myproc = Process->new();

             $myproc->start("sleep 10");           # Shell process
         OR
             $myproc->start(sub { sleep 10; });    # Perl Sub

             print "alive!\n" if $myproc->poll();

             $myproc->kill();


Manpages:    Embedded in Process.pm as usual:

             pod2man Process.pm | nroff -man | more


Installation:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make 
	make test
	make install


Have fun!
