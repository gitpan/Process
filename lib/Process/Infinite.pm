=head1 NAME

Process::Infinite - Base class for processes that do not naturally end

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Process::Infinite> is a base class for L<Process> objects that will
not naturally finish without provocation from outside the process.

Examples of this are system "daemons" and servers of various types.

At the present time this class is purely indicative. It contains no
additional functionality.

=head2 Stopping Your Process

When writing a C<Process::Infinite> class, the most important thing to
note is how you plan to shutdown your process. This will vary from
case to case but the general implementation tends to be the same.

Your C<run> class consists of a main loop. How often this loop will
fire will vary, but it should generally fire at least once a second
or so.

The loop will check a flag or do some other cheap task to know if it
is time to stop, then shutdown gracefully. You will then add some form
of signal handler that sets the shutdown flag.

On UNIX platforms, you should at the very least add a signal handler
for C<SIGTERM>, as this is what will be sent to you by the operating
system when it shuts down. (If you don't respond in a few seconds, it
will then C<SIGKILL> and take out your running process by force, with
no chance for you to shut down gracefully)
